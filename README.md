Rebuild of MA3 in html & css course on Noroff front-end Development

Teacher feedback on the original assignment grade - 6/10

Hi Alexander

The form is working correctly and all the data gets sent on submit.

I'd recommend a radio button for the crust options and a checkbox for the extras so users can add multiple extras.

If you're wanting to collect the date from a user, you can use the date input https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date

There isn't a way to choose a type of pizza (Margherita, Hawaiian etc.).

The layout of the page could use a bit of work. There's lots of lines with all the fieldsets. One option is having less fieldsets (one for user details and one for order details might work) or removing the border. The logo is Times New Roman because the 'Futura' font isn't loaded to the browser and there's no comma between Helvetica and sans-serif so neither backups load.

The HTML is neat which is great to see. It's mostly semantic apart from the 'p' tags in the select, and the 'article' around the form. The 'article' element is for articles like you'd find in a newspaper, blog, or magazine.

No CSS attribute selector as per the brief unfortunately.

Overall, good work especially seeing as you didn't have as much time on the delivery.

1) Fix teachers feedback mistakes.

2) Improve font selection for headers and text.

3) Improve colors and site layout.
