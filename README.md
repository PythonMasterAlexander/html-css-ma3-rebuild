Rebuild of MA3 in html & css course on Noroff front-end Development

Teacher feedback on the original assignment grade - 6/10

Hi Alexander

The form is working correctly and all the data gets sent on submit.

I'd recommend a radio button for the crust options and a checkbox for the extras so users can add multiple extras.

If you're wanting to collect the date from a user, you can use the date input https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date

There isn't a way to choose a type of pizza (Margherita, Hawaiian etc.).

The layout of the page could use a bit of work. There's lots of lines with all the fieldsets. 
One option is having less fieldsets (one for user details and one for order details might work) or removing the border. 
The logo is Times New Roman because the 'Futura' font isn't loaded to the browser and there's no comma between Helvetica 
and sans-serif so neither backups load.

The HTML is neat which is great to see. It's mostly semantic apart from the 'p' tags in the select, and the 'article' around the form. 
The 'article' element is for articles like you'd find in a newspaper, blog, or magazine.

No CSS attribute selector as per the brief unfortunately.

Overall, good work especially seeing as you didn't have as much time on the delivery.

Module Assignment

Level 1 Process
To use CSS to style a form page.

You have been tasked with creating an order form for Red Pepper Pizza restaurant. Taking the feedback you received about your Style Tile, 
create an easy to use order form using HTML and CSS.

You should create a single form page with a navigation section, form, and footer. Your CSS styles should all be in an external style sheet 
and linked to in your HTML file. You should use two different fonts on your page.

Create your HTML page and your CSS page.
Create your navigation and footer sections. Style these sections, and use the descendant selector where appropriate. The links in your navigation don't need to go anywhere.
Add your form to the page. The form should contain the following: a dropdown for the pizza options for the user, an option for them to decide if they want thin or thick crust, and then an option to select optional extras for the pizza.
Use CSS attribute selectors to format the form elements.
The form should have a submit button with a hover and active pseudo class.
Finally style any remaining sections using classes or IDs where appropriate.

Level 2 Process
Set your form to have a method of "GET" and check your URL to see the data pulling through when the form is submitted. 
If the data isn't displaying correctly, make sure you have names and values set for your inputs.

Start from scratch again, create only one page.

1) Fix teachers feedback mistakes.

2) Improve font selection for headers and text.
